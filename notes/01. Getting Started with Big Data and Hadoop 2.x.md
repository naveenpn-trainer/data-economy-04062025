# Getting Started with Big Data and Hadoop 2.x

> Big Data refers to the data which is **large, fast and complex type** of <u>structured, semi-structured and unstructured data</u>, generated from variety of different source, which becomes **difficult to store and process** using a **traditional processing system**

**Challenges of Big Data**

1. Storage : Distributed Storage System
2. Processing : Massive Parallel Processing System

## Hadoop 2.x (Distributed Storage and Processing System)

> Hadoop is a software framework, **which allows us to store and process huge volume** of data in parallel and distributed fashion

### Components of Hadoop 2.x

1. Storage Layer : HDFS
2. Resource Management Layer : YARN
3. Processing Layer : MapReduce

## HDFS (Hadoop Distributed FS)

> HDFS is a distributed and a scalable file system designed for storing very large files.
